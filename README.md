## Team

To adjust your profile on the *Team* page, go to the **_data** directory, and choose the corresponding .yml file (phds, zap, ...). In there you can write your **name**, some **info** and an **image** (make sure to add the correct extension). The images are taken from the **_images\teampic** directory. Preferred aspect ratio is 1:1.

## News



## Homepage slideshow

In carousel.yml you can choose an **image**, a **caption**, a  **subcaption**, and finally a **link** that the central button will send you to (a paper, a news article, a research topic etc.) Images are taken from the **_images\carouselpic** directory. They are automatically resized to height 300px, so make sure your image has the right dimensions. TODO: 1. 1 adjust font, fontcolor etc.
