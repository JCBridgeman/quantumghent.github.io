# Fundamental theorems for PEPS
### Andras Molnar (Universidad Complutense de Madrid)

Tensor networks are generated by a set of small rank tensors and define many-body quantum states in a succinct form. The corresponding map is not one-to-one: different sets of tensors may generate the very same state. A fundamental question in the study of tensor networks naturally arises: what is the relation between those different sets, if there is one at all? The answer to this question in one dimensional setups has found several applications, like the characterization of local and global symmetries, the classification of phases of matter and unitary evolutions, or the determination of the fixed points of renormalization procedures. In this talk I explore what are the possible answers to this question for projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in two- and  more dimensions.
