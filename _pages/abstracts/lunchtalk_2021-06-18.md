# Isometric Tensor Networks States
### Sheng-Hsuan Lin (Technical University MÃ¼nchen)

Isometric tensor network states (isoTNSs) generalizes the isometric conditions of the canonical form of one-dimensional matrix-product states to tensor networks in higher dimensions. I will give an overview about the isoTNSs focusing on isoPEPS and discuss some technical details regarding the implementation of isoTNSs-based algorithms including TEBD^2 and DMRG^2. If time permitted, I will discuss their connection with autoregressive quantum states.
