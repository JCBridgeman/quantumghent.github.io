# Dualities in quantum many-body physics
### Gerardo Ortiz (Indiana University, Bloomington)
Dualities appear in nearly all disciplines of physics and play a central role in statistical mechanics and field theory. I will discuss in a pedagogical manner our bond-algebraic techniques which provide a simple unifying framework for the detection and treatment of dualities.
