# Non-Abelian Topological Order and Fractons from Measuring Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
### Ruben Verresen (Harvard University)
A defining property of topological order is that it is difficult to create by any unitary process, requiring a time scaling with system size. Here, we will discuss a loophole which obtains these states from single-site measurements on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases---the latter being prepared by finite-depth unitary circuits. This generalizes previously known examples, such as measuring the cluster state to obtain the toric code, by observing that one can physically enact the Kramers-Wannier or Jordan-Wigner transformation on an arbitrary initial state. Remarkably, some of these schemes can be implemented in existing Rydberg atom array platforms to efficiently create non-abelian topological order and potentially the first experimental realization of fracton order.
