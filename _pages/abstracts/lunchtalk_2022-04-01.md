# Conformal field theory from lattice fermions
### Alexander Stottmeister (University of Hannover)

I will explain how conformal field theories (CFT) based on free lattice fermions can be recovered by operator algebraic renormalization and the Koo-Saleur formula. As an application this entails rigorous error bounds for the quantum simulation of CFTs.
