# Quantum Sine-Gordon dynamics in coupled spin chains
### Elisabeth Wybo (Technical University of Munchen, Garching)
The sine-Gordon field theory emerges as the low-energy description in a
wealth of quantum many-body systems. Recent efforts have been directed
towards realizing quantum simulators of the model, by interfering two
weakly coupled one-dimensional cold atomic gases. The weak interactions
within the atomic clouds provide a sine-Gordon realization in the
semiclassical regime. Furthermore, the complex microscopic dynamics
prevents a quantitative understanding of the effective sine-Gordon
validity realm.
Here, we focus on a spin ladder realization and observe the emergent
sine-Gordon dynamics deep in the quantum regime. We use matrix-product
state techniques to numerically characterize the low-energy sector of
the system and compare it with the exact field theory predictions. From
this comparison, we obtain quantitative boundaries for the validity of
the sine-Gordon description. We provide encompassing evidence for the
emergent field theory by probing its rich spectrum and by observing the
signatures of integrable dynamics in scattering events. Finally, we
discuss some possible experimental probes.
