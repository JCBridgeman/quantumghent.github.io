# Enriched fusion categories and domain walls between anomalous topological orders
### Corey Jones (North Carolina State University)
We apply the higher categorical framework of enriched fusion categories 
to characterize and study domain walls between anomalous topological 
orders.  In our approach, we fix a 3+1D bulk anomaly described by a UMTC 
A, and view 2+1D topological orders as A-enriched fusion categories. We 
then explain how to characterize (and perform computations with) 
topological domain walls in a manner closely paralleling the 
non-anomalous case in terms of A-enriched bimodule categories. Based on 
joint work with Peter Huston, Fiona Burnell, and David Penneys.
