# Virasoro and Kac-Moody operators in Tensor networks revisited
### Jent Hung (Fudan University)
We propose a general implementation of the Virasoro generators and Kacâ€“Moody currents in generic tensor network representations of 2-dimensional critical lattice models. Our proposal works even when a quantum Hamiltonian of the lattice model is not available, which is the case in many numerical computations involving numerical blockings. We tested our proposal on the 2d Ising model, and also the dimer model, which works to high accuracy even with a fairly small system size. Our method makes use of eigenstates of a small cylinder to generate descendant states in a larger cylinder, suggesting some intricate algebraic relations between lattices of different sizes.
