# Efficient higher-order matrix product operators for time evolution
### Maarten Van Damme (SandboxAQ)
We introduce a systematic construction of higher-order matrix product operator (MPO) approximations of the time evolution operator for generic (short and long range) one-dimensional Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the utility of our construction, by showing an order of magnitude speedup in simulation cost compared to conventional first-order MPO time evolution schemes.
