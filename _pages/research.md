# Research

## Tensor networks

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Tensor networks provide a new mathematical and computational framework for tackling the central theoretical problem in physics, namely the quantum many-body problem, and more specifically the problem of strongly interacting systems.  The quantum many-body problem deals with the description of a large collection of particles, and forms the foundation upon which all our understanding of condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, quantum chemistry and statistical physics is build. The central concepts of tensor networks originate from the field of quantum information and computation, in which quantum entanglement is exploited to perform information tasks exponentially faster than possible using classical means.<br>
Around 2003, a collaboration of members of the Ghent Quantum Group and Ignacio Cirac from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics discovered that the theory of entanglement provides a fundamentally new language for describing interactions and correlations in generic quantum many-body systems. Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, while the syntax is provided by quantum tensor networks. In essence, we discovered how to describe many-body wavefunctions in terms of local tensors expressing how entanglement is routed. These local tensors act as a novel type of non-local order parameters, and we study their symmetries as reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system, uncovering a precise characterization of algebraic structures previously discovered in statistical physics, condensed matter physics and conformal field theory.<br>
The central goal of our research is to reveal the semantics of those entanglement patterns in interacting many-body systems, and to use this knowledge to construct algorithms for simulating strongly correlated systems. To achieve this, we develop novel theoretical and computational approaches to tensor networks, and apply those to problems in the context of ultracold gases, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum computing. We  formulate variational and real-space renormalization-group methods for generic many-body problems and quantum field theories, construct scaling methods based on entanglement renormalization, devise new algorithms for simulating time dependent phenomena in state of the art experiments with cold atoms, and use tensor networks to construct novel quantum error correcting codes. A unique feature of our research is the fact that the theoretical and computational aspects are not parallel lines of development, but one and the same: we fuse the intricate mathematical structures of tensor networks and tensor fusion categories with very tangible numerical simulations of quantum many body systems.

### Quantum Entanglement

<i> When two systems, of which we know the states by their respective representation, enter into a temporary physical interaction due to known forces between them and when after a time of mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no longer be described as before, viz., by endowing each of them with a representative of its own. I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics. </i> (Erwin Schrodinger) <br>

	
Quantum Entanglement taught us that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, and is responsible for all magic and wonder in quantum mechanics. We are only recently starting to understand how to describe and exploit entanglement, and research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent focuses on studying entanglement in the many-body context.
