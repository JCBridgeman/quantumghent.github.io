## Tensor networks

<p style="text-align:justify">
Tensor networks provide a new mathematical and computational framework for tackling the central theoretical problem in physics, namely the quantum many-body problem, and more specifically the problem of strongly interacting systems.  The quantum many-body problem deals with the description of a large collection of particles, and forms the foundation upon which all our understanding of condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, quantum chemistry and statistical physics is build. The central concepts of tensor networks originate from the field of quantum information and computation, in which quantum entanglement is exploited to perform information tasks exponentially faster than possible using classical means.<br>
Around 2003, a collaboration of members of the Ghent Quantum Group and Ignacio Cirac from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics discovered that the theory of entanglement provides a fundamentally new language for describing interactions and correlations in generic quantum many-body systems. Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, while the syntax is provided by quantum tensor networks. In essence, we discovered how to describe many-body wavefunctions in terms of local tensors expressing how entanglement is routed. These local tensors act as a novel type of non-local order parameters, and we study their symmetries as reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system, uncovering a precise characterization of algebraic structures previously discovered in statistical physics, condensed matter physics and conformal field theory.<br>
The central goal of our research is to reveal the semantics of those entanglement patterns in interacting many-body systems, and to use this knowledge to construct algorithms for simulating strongly correlated systems. To achieve this, we develop novel theoretical and computational approaches to tensor networks, and apply those to problems in the context of ultracold gases, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum computing. We  formulate variational and real-space renormalization-group methods for generic many-body problems and quantum field theories, construct scaling methods based on entanglement renormalization, devise new algorithms for simulating time dependent phenomena in state of the art experiments with cold atoms, and use tensor networks to construct novel quantum error correcting codes. A unique feature of our research is the fact that the theoretical and computational aspects are not parallel lines of development, but one and the same: we fuse the intricate mathematical structures of tensor networks and tensor fusion categories with very tangible numerical simulations of quantum many body systems.<br>

## Quantum Entanglement
<p style="text-align:justify">

<i> When two systems, of which we know the states by their respective representation, enter into a temporary physical interaction due to known forces between them and when after a time of mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no longer be described as before, viz., by endowing each of them with a representative of its own. I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics. </i> (Erwin Schrodinger) <br>

	
Quantum Entanglement taught us that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, and is responsible for all magic and wonder in quantum mechanics. On the one hand, it is responsible for the exponential scaling of and difficulty in simualting quantum many-body systems. On the other hand, it is precisely the key ingredient which enables the exponential speed-ups in future quantum computers, a topic of extreme current interest. We are  currently very much in the process of starting to understand how to describe and exploit entanglement, and research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent focuses on studying entanglement in the many-body context. <br><br>

## Quantum Field Theory
<p style="text-align:justify">

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) provides a unified framework for describing both effective and fundamental theories of quantum many-body systems in the continuum. It is the de-facto language in which we can understand critical phenomena and the renormalization group, and QFT has been enormously successful in describing a wealth of phenomena seen in high energy physics and in condensed matter physics. Although QFT has been around for almost a century, there are still fantastic difficulties to overcome in the regime of strong correlations and/or coupling, it is in situations where the usual perturbative expansions in terms of Feynman diagrams fail. <br> <br>

One of the long-term goals of the Quantum Group @ Ugent is to construct a comprehensive real-space based framework  to tackle QFT in this strong coupling regime. Our methods of choice are tensor networks, and we are both developing the mathematical framework as well as powerful new algorithms for simulating such systems. <br> <br>

### Quantum Error Correction

<p style="text-align:justify">

As quantum computers are much more susceptible to noise than classical ones, the biggest theoretical challenge in building a scalable quantum computer is the construction of efficient fault tolerant quantum error correction schemes. The theory of quantum error correction provides fascinating connections between a wide variety of different fields in theoretical physics, including topological field theory, lattice gauge theories, anyons, spin glasses, quantum entanglement and the renormalization group. The most widely studied quantum error correcting codes are based on the so-called stabilitzer formalism, which has the big drawback that quantum operations have to be performed outside of the code space to make the scheme useful for univeral quantum computation. Other universal codes have been proposed, but those are much harder to analyze and implement. <br>

Our research focuses on using tensor networks to devise universal non-Abelian quantum error correcting codes and decoding strategies. To achieve this, we have developed the formalism of tube algebras and matrix product operator symmetries, and implement Monte-Carlo based tensor network routines to study their efficiency. <br> <br>

### Quantum Computing
<p style="text-align:justify">

Quantum Computers promise to be the next quantum leap in the development of supercomputers. Their power stems from the fact that quantum systems can evolve in a superposition of an exponential amount of different paths, and thereby allow to solve a select number of relevant problems exponentially faster than possible with a classical computer. As originally observed by Feynman, quantum mechanics has provided us with a fully untapped source of computational power, and only since recently is the technology being developed using superconducting systems and/or quantum optical setups to make this dream a reality.  <br> <br>

Research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent on quantum computation is focused on  different aspects. <br>

First, we are devising quantum algorithms for simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems in and out of equilibrium; we strongly believe that this will be the killer application of quantum computers, with applications ranging from simualating the Langrangian of the standard model to the simulation of chemical reactions of medicinal drugs. The Ugent group was the first one to discover two of the central algorithms to make this possible: an algorithm for the efficient preparation of Slater determinatns on a quantum computer (which can then be projected on the exact  ground state of an interesting system by doing a non-demolition energy measurement), and the so-called "quantum Metropolis sampling" algorithm which allows a quantum computer to sample directly from the eigenstates of a quantum Hamiltonian, thereby demonstrating that quantum computer can overcome the ubiquitous sign problem. Current research is focused on how to adopt such quantum simulators to specific experimental settings, and to devise efficient regularization schemes for simulating quantum field theories on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we explore how fermionic many body systems can be simulated efficiently using a system of qubits. <br>
Second, we study notions in complexity theory to quantify the complexity of relevant computational tasks to be run on a quantum computer. For example, we proved that the universal density functional in density functional theory is intractable, as it would allow to solve quantum NP-hard problems. We are also characterizing relations between the quantum marginal problem and the problem of finding ground states of interacting systems. <br>
Third, we are using the formalism of tensor networks to devise novel quantum error correcting codes. Constructing non-Abelian codes which allow for universal quantum computation in its codespace is the central theoretical challenge that has to be solved to build scalable quantum computers, and it turns out that tensor netorks and more specifically PEPS are the exacy tool that is needed for the the analysis of such codes. <br>
Fourth, a new type of statisitics is needed to analyse quantum experiments. We have introduced several quantum statistical tests for achieving this, such as the quantum chi-squared test, and have solved central problems in the field of quantum hypothesis testing, wherre we derived the quantum Chernoff and Hoefdding bounds. <br>
Fifth, the Quantum Group @ Ugent was the first to prove the equivalence of the measurment based quantum computation formalism to the standard quantum circuit model using a nontrivial mapping to tensor networks. Furthermore, our theoretical research on dissipative quantum computation led to a paradigm shift into the way we look at decoherence and invigorated a large worldwide experimental effort to implement dissipative protocols.<br><br>
