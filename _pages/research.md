## Tensor networks

<p style="text-align:justify">
Tensor networks provide a new mathematical and computational framework for tackling the central theoretical problem in physics, namely the quantum many-body problem, and more specifically the problem of strongly interacting systems.  The quantum many-body problem deals with the description of a large collection of particles, and forms the foundation upon which all our understanding of condensed matter physics, quantum field theory, quantum chemistry and statistical physics is build. The central concepts of tensor networks originate from the field of quantum information and computation, in which quantum entanglement is exploited to perform information tasks exponentially faster than possible using classical means.<br>
Around 2003, a collaboration of members of the Ghent Quantum Group and Ignacio Cirac from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics discovered that the theory of entanglement provides a fundamentally new language for describing interactions and correlations in generic quantum many-body systems. Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, while the syntax is provided by quantum tensor networks. In essence, we discovered how to describe many-body wavefunctions in terms of local tensors expressing how entanglement is routed. These local tensors act as a novel type of non-local order parameters, and we study their symmetries as reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system, uncovering a precise characterization of algebraic structures previously discovered in statistical physics, condensed matter physics and conformal field theory.<br>
The central goal of our research is to reveal the semantics of those entanglement patterns in interacting many-body systems, and to use this knowledge to construct algorithms for simulating strongly correlated systems. To achieve this, we develop novel theoretical and computational approaches to tensor networks, and apply those to problems in the context of ultracold gases, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum computing. We  formulate variational and real-space renormalization-group methods for generic many-body problems and quantum field theories, construct scaling methods based on entanglement renormalization, devise new algorithms for simulating time dependent phenomena in state of the art experiments with cold atoms, and use tensor networks to construct novel quantum error correcting codes. A unique feature of our research is the fact that the theoretical and computational aspects are not parallel lines of development, but one and the same: we fuse the intricate mathematical structures of tensor networks and tensor fusion categories with very tangible numerical simulations of quantum many body systems.<br>
Wilson’s renormalization-group program revolutionized the way we understand and think about physics, and tensor network based techniques provide the next step. Modelling the entanglement degrees of freedom through tensor networks seems to grant precisely the means to realize the visionary program set forward by Feynman in '88:<br><br>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align:justify">
<i>  Now, in field theory, what’s going on over here and what’s going on over there and all over space is more or less the same. Why do we have to keep track in our functional of all things going on over there while we are looking at the things that are going on over here?... It’s really quite insane, actually: we are trying to find the energy by taking the expectation value of an operator which is located here and we present ourselves with a functional which is dependent on everything all over the map. That’s something wrong. Maybe there is some way to surround the object, or the region where we want to calculate things, by a surface and describe what things are coming in across the surface. It tells us everything that’s going on outside.</i>

## Quantum Entanglement
<p style="text-align:justify">

<i> When two systems, of which we know the states by their respective representation, enter into a temporary physical interaction due to known forces between them and when after a time of mutual influence the systems separate again, then they can no longer be described as before, viz., by endowing each of them with a representative of its own. I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics. </i> (Erwin Schrodinger) <br>


Quantum Entanglement taught us that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, and is responsible for all magic and wonder in quantum mechanics. On the one hand, it is responsible for the exponential scaling of and difficulty in simualting quantum many-body systems. On the other hand, it is precisely the key ingredient which enables the exponential speed-ups in future quantum computers, a topic of extreme current interest. We are  currently very much in the process of starting to understand how to describe and exploit entanglement, and research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent focuses on studying entanglement in the many-body context. <br><br>

## Quantum Field Theory
<p style="text-align:justify">

Quantum Field Theory (QFT) provides a unified framework for describing both effective and fundamental theories of quantum many-body systems in the continuum. It is the de-facto language in which we can understand critical phenomena and the renormalization group, and QFT has been enormously successful in describing a wealth of phenomena seen in high energy physics and in condensed matter physics. Although QFT has been around for almost a century, there are still fantastic difficulties to overcome in the regime of strong correlations and/or coupling, it is in situations where the usual perturbative expansions in terms of Feynman diagrams fail. <br> <br>

One of the long-term goals of the Quantum Group @ Ugent is to construct a comprehensive real-space based framework  to tackle QFT in this strong coupling regime. Our methods of choice are tensor networks, and we are both developing the mathematical framework as well as powerful new algorithms for simulating such systems. <br> <br>

### Quantum Error Correction

<p style="text-align:justify">

As quantum systems are much more susceptible to noise than classical ones, the biggest theoretical challenge in building a scalable quantum computer is the construction of efficient fault tolerant quantum error correction schemes. The theory of quantum error correction provides fascinating connections between a wide variety of different fields in theoretical physics, including topological field theory, lattice gauge theories, anyons, spin glasses, quantum entanglement and the renormalization group. The most widely studied quantum error correcting codes are based on the so-called stabilitzer formalism, which has the big drawback that quantum operations have to be performed outside of the code space to make the scheme useful for univeral quantum computation. Other universal codes have been proposed, but those are much harder to analyze and implement. <br>

Our research focuses on using tensor networks to devise universal non-Abelian quantum error correcting codes and decoding strategies. To achieve this, we have developed the formalism of tube algebras and matrix product operator symmetries, and implement Monte-Carlo based tensor network routines to study their efficiency. <br> <br>

### Quantum Computing
<p style="text-align:justify">

Quantum Computers promise to be the next quantum leap in the development of supercomputers. Their power stems from the fact that quantum systems can evolve in a superposition of an exponential amount of different paths, and thereby allow to solve a select number of relevant problems exponentially faster than possible with a classical computer. As originally observed by Feynman, quantum mechanics has provided us with a fully untapped source of computational power, and only since recently is the technology being developed using superconducting systems and/or quantum optical setups to make this dream a reality. The research field of quantum information merges two of the biggest scientific triumphs of 20th century, namely quantum mechanics and information theory. It is an extremely active and interdisciplanry field, and poses a wealth of fascinating and tractable problems and puzzles both from the experimental and theoretical side.  <br> <br>

Research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent on quantum computation is focused on  different aspects. <br> <br>

First, we are devising quantum algorithms for simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems in and out of equilibrium; we strongly believe that this will be the killer application of quantum computers, with applications ranging from simualating the Langrangian of the standard model to the simulation of chemical reactions of medicinal drugs. The Ugent group was the first one to discover two of the central algorithms to make this possible: an algorithm for the efficient preparation of Slater determinants on a quantum computer (which can then be projected on the exact  ground state of an interesting system by doing a non-demolition energy measurement), and the so-called "quantum Metropolis sampling" algorithm which allows a quantum computer to sample directly from the eigenstates of a quantum Hamiltonian, thereby demonstrating that a quantum computer can overcome the ubiquitous sign problem. Current research is focused on how to adopt such quantum simulators to specific experimental settings, and to devise efficient regularization schemes for simulating quantum field theories on a quantum computer. Furthermore, we explore how fermionic many body systems can be encoded efficiently using a system of qubits. <br> <br>
Second, we study notions in complexity theory to quantify the complexity of relevant computational tasks to be run on a quantum computer. For example, we proved that the universal density functional in density functional theory is intractable, as it would allow to solve quantum NP-hard problems. We are also characterizing relations between the quantum marginal problem and the problem of finding ground states of interacting systems. <br> <br>
Third, we are using the formalism of tensor networks to devise novel quantum error correcting codes. Constructing non-Abelian codes which allow for universal quantum computation in its codespace is the central theoretical challenge that has to be solved to build scalable quantum computers, and it turns out that tensor networks and more specifically PEPS provide the perfect tool that is needed for the the analysis of such codes. <br> <br>
Fourth, a new type of statisitics is needed to analyse quantum experiments. We have introduced several key quantum statistical tests for achieving this, such as the quantum chi-squared test, and have solved central problems in the field of quantum hypothesis testing, wherre we derived the quantum Chernoff and Hoefdding bounds. <br> <br>
Fifth, the Quantum Group @ Ugent was the first to prove the equivalence of the measurment based quantum computation formalism to the standard quantum circuit model using a nontrivial mapping to tensor networks. Furthermore, our theoretical research on dissipative quantum computation led to a paradigm shift into the way we look at decoherence and invigorated a large worldwide experimental effort to implement dissipative protocols.<br><br>

### Matrix Product States

<p style="text-align:justify">

Matrix Product States (MPS) lie at the core of the tensor network formalism, and embody the entanglement structure of quantum many body systems arranged in a 1-Dimensional spin chain geometry. They provide an exponential compression of the Hilbert space relevant for describing the low-energy features of the corresponding quantum Hamiltonians, and thereby demonstrate that the exponential many-body wall can be breached by describing quantum systems through their quantum correlations and entanglement degrees of freedom as opposed to doing this by the physical spins. As such, MPS form an explicit and constructive realization of the holographic principle. <br> <br>

Research in the Quantum Group @ Ugent focuses on both the theoretical and computational aspects of MPS.  From the theoretical point of view, we have intense collaborations with the groups of I. Cirac (Max Planck), D. Perez-Garcia (Madrid) and N. Schuch (Vienna). We demonstrated that MPS form faithful representations of quantum systems satisfying an area law for the entanglement entropy; put forward the concept of matrix product operators (MPO);  proved the fundamental theorem of MPS, a formalism that opened the doors to classifying interacting quantum phases of matter; introduced the concept of continuous MPS, providing the first example of a succesfull variational method for interacting field theories; build the formalism of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) for MPS, showing that the manifold of MPS is a Kahler manifold endowed with a Poisson bracket structure and that the corresponding tangent plane defines an effective low-energy Hamiltonian projection of the full Hamiltonian; advanced the concept of matrix product operator algebras, opening up fascinating connections between tensor networks and fusion categories; established the framework of gauge symmetries in MPS; brought up the theory of fermionic MPS through the concept of graded Z2 algebra; and discovered non-commutative versions of the Gross-Pitaevski equation by using TDVP on the manifold of continuous MPS. Current research efforts focus on the mathematical framework of matrix product operator algebras, on the consrtruction of a comprehensive framework for dealing with fermions and anyons, and on unravelling the entanglement properties of continuous MPS.<br><br>

From the computational point of view, we are actively developing MPS algorithms for finding ground states of quantum spin Hamiltonians and for finding fixed points of matrix product operators as encountered in the partition functions of 2-D statistical mechanical models and in the contraction of PEPS algorithms.  Recent advances include the introduction of the state of the art MPS method for simulaitng uniform systems in the thermodynamic limit, called the variational uniform matrix product state algorithm (VUMPS), and the advancement of the so-called tangent plane formalism for describing non-equilibrium phenomena in spin chains (also called TDVP algorithms) and for describing low-energy excitations of generic strongly correlated quantum spin chains. We are studying scattering theory of those excitations, and do research on MPO-based ways of simulating thermalization in closed quantum many body systems. We investigate the problem of simulating frustrated statistical mechanics models in 2-D, and construct entanglement scaling methods for simulating critical spin systems. We establish connections between neural networks and  the MPS formalism, devise algorithms to extend the MPS formalism to tree tensor networks, and construct methods to simulate quantum field theories in the continuum limit. We are also actively pursuing robust variational algorithms for dealing with continuous MPS, introduce novel optimization algorithms based on Grassmann manifolds, and incorporate powerful ideas originating from the field of machine learning such as backwards and automatic differentiation.  <br> <br>

We large focus of our research effort is also the building of comprehensive state of the art open-source tensor network libraries in Julia and Matlab that can deal with all possible symmetries and particle statistics. (Link to Software)

### Projected Entangled Pair States

<p style="text-align:justify">

Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) form the perfect incarnation of tensor networks, and embody their full complexity and elegance. PEPS provide a unified description of quantum many body wavefunctions on arbitrary lattices and in arbitrary dimensions that satisfy an area law for their entanglement entropy. PEPS were introduced in 2004 through a collaboration of the Quantum Group @ Ugent and Ignacio Cirac from the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, and form a very active field of research as they bear the promise to crack open the quantum many-body problem for strongly correlated fermions in 2-D.<br>
On the one hand, PEPS form a rich class of variational wavefunctions which provide state of the art results for the simulation of strongly correlated systems on finite and infinite  2-D lattices; very active and worldwide research is currently been done to come up with efficient and robust methods to optimize this class of wavefunctions. On the other hand, PEPS wavefunctions are representative for extremely interesting and exotic topological phases of matter, and as such reveal the entanglement structure of such phases. The mathematical framework for dealing with PEPS has a lot of overlap with so-called fusion categories, an abstract set of ideas which underlie advanced topics in theoretical physics such as topological field theory and conformal field theory.<br>
PEPS forms the core of the central mission of the Quantum Group @ Ugent, which is to advance the theory of tensor networks and use this to construct novel variational algorithms and software to simulate strongly correlated systems.<br><br>

### Cold Atoms

<p style="text-align:justify">

The current state of the art experiments probing the quantum many-body features of strongly correlated systems happen in the realm of cold atoms. Using advanced cooling and trapping techniques, it has become possible  to manipulate and observe individual quantum particles, and to let them exhibit fascinating collective behaviour. Keywords are Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC), ion traps, optical lattices and atom chips. <br><br>

We are currently building the first BEC-laboratory in Belgium, which will consist of a Rubidium 87 BEC supplanted with an acousto-optical projection system (AOD). From our point of view, this BEC system is an effective quantum simulator by which we will be able to simulate a wide variety of interesting quantum many-body systems, including non-equilibrium phenomena and many-body analogues of quantum gravity. <br><br>

Form the point of view of tensor networks, cold atom experiments provide a wealth of interesting applications; in many ways, tensor network algorithms provide the only benchmark for evaluating the correctness of the experiments. Cold atoms also pose unique new problems and suggest a wide variety of new directions in which tensor network algorithms should be generalized and improved. <br><br>

### Strongly Correlated Systems
<p style="text-align:justify">

Research in theoretical quantum physics is to a large extent a quest to understand strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Be it particle physics, condensed matter physics, atomic physics or quantum chemistry, the central problem is the one of treating strongly correlated systems, and almost all breakthroughs since the last 70 years involved the construction of approximation methods by which such systems can be described. Such physics problems of great interest that still lack a satisfactory theoretical or computational description are e.g. the ubiquitous Hubbard model (modeling interacting electrons on a lattice) and Quantum Chromodynamics (describing the strong force between quarks). Devising better methods for simulating or describing such systems in all relevant regimes would have an enormous impact, and might lead to breakthroughs in e.g. unraveling the mechanism of high Tc-superconductivity.<br>

A main characteristic of strongly correlated systems is the fact that they are much more naturally described in real-space coordinates than in momentum space ones, the last ones being the natural coordinates for describing weakly interacting systems through perturbation theory on top of a Slater determinant or Gaussian state. Tensor networks can precisely be seen as a program to implement the real-space option -  treating the kinetic energy terms as a perturbation to the (local) interaction terms. This allows to describe many-body systems in phases that cannot be reached adiabatically from free theories - and such systems are precisely the ones with the most interesting entanglement structure and exotic quantum features. Furthermore, tensor networks do this in a way such that there is a systematic way of improving the approximations - thereby providing a very versatile variational framework to tackle strongly correlated system - the hardest problem in physics.<br><br>
