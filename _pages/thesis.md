<p>In spring 2022 we are launching the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent. Worldwide such cold atom experiments are currently leading the way in our explorations of the quantum realm. In summary, a BEC consists of >10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case), that are cooled to temperatures T<1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one coherent quantum state. The spectacular advances in controlling and manipulating the cold BEC atoms allow the experimental realization of many different exotic quantum phenomena like quantum tunneling, quantum non-equilibrium physics, superfluidity, and even the quantum simulation of black holes. It is the latter avenue that we want to explore with this thesis.</p>

<p>In 1975 Stephen Hawking publishes his spectacular result on the quantum behavior of black holes. In his paper 'Particle creation by black holes' Hawking demonstrates that the vacuum of a relativistic quantum field theory on a space-time with an event horizon produces radiation. In other words, a quantum black hole is not really black, it emits radiation at a certain Hawking temperature. Unfortunately, for realistic astrophysical black holes this predicted Hawking temperature is orders of magnitudes below the temperature of the cosmic background radiation, eluding experimental detection. And as such the Hawking effect has predominantly been studied purely theoretically, as it seems to offer important clues towards a theory of quantum gravity.</p>

<p>However, in the eighties Bill Unruh advocated that the Hawking effect is universal, in the sense that it can appear in many different other systems. In particular, he realized that the behavior of the large-scale fluctuations of (super)fluids (the phonons) can be mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) on a particular space-time, with the space-time metric depending on the (super)fluid velocity. This opened up new possibilities for experimentally realizing the Hawking effect; and BECs indeed seemed the perfect candidate for this. Incidentally, the term 'quantum simulation'  denominates precisely the realization of a certain quantum behavior by an experimental quantum system that can be controlled and manipulated.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis is to study and explore the BEC quantum simulation of a black hole towards actual experiments on our set-up. Notice that in a series of experiments from 2010 till now, Jeff Steinhauer has already been working up to such a feat, with a claimed experimental detection of Hawking radiation in 2017. However, this claim was put in doubt by other physicists. In any case, the thesis fits in the grand goal of replicating and/or improving on these experiments.</p>

<p>For such a BEC analogue black hole experiment we can roughly delineate two steps. First one has to bring the BEC in the supersonic regime, i.e. a regime where the BEC superfluid flows faster than the phonon speed. It is in this regime that the effective black hole metric is realized. The second step then consists of detecting the Hawking radiation. This is found through correlated fluctuations (Hawking pairs) at both sides of the horizon. Notice that in contrast to actual black holes, for a simulated quantum black hole one indeed has access to both sides of the horizon. Experimentally, these correlations are found through the measurement of expectation values, by performing many different (automated) versions of the same experimental protocol. The challenge here is to separate the actual quantum fluctuations, from other fluctuations that are inherent to the experiment.</p>

<p>This thesis draws from different fields: quantum optics, quantum field theory, relativity, numerical analysis and cold atom physics. Of course we don't expect the student to master all these fields. As the thesis fits within a larger research goal of our group, depending on their interests and skills the student will have the freedom to focus more on the theoretical, numerical or experimental part of the project.</p>

<hr><h2>A tensor network approach to higher dimensional lattice gauge theories</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The concept of gauge symmetries is ubiquitous in many-body physics. Most notably, it underpins the Standard Model of elementary particle physics where the fundamental interactions of nature arise from the gauging of global symmetries, but gauge theories also appear in the context of low-temperature condensed matter systems. For small coupling regimes they can be studied using perturbation theory, giving rise to the well-known Feynman diagrammatic approach to quantum field theories. In the theory of quantum electrodynamics this approach has led to results with an unrivaled precision. In contrast, this perturbative approach breaks down entirely when interactions become strong. Most notably, this is the case for the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which describes the strong interaction, where all low energy features are essentially non-perturbative.</p>

<p>Currently, the most accurate description of the strongly coupled behavior of gauge theories stems from a discrete formulation in terms of lattice gauge theory [1]. Over the past decades lattice QCD computations based on Monte Carlo sampling have reached impressive accuracy, for instance in the ab initio determination of the light hadron masses. In spite of these remarkable results, lattice Monte Carlo sampling suffers from some significant drawbacks. Firstly, the use of Euclidean time in these calculations does not allow for real-time simulations of dynamical non-equilibrium phenomena, such as those of interest for example in early universe cosmology. In addition, the Monte Carlo sign problem prevents the study of systems with finite fermion densities.</p>

<p>Tensor network states form a variational class of wavefunctions that have proven extremely useful for describing low-energy physics of strongly correlated quantum many body systems. They constitute a non-perturbative approach to Hamiltonian systems, support finite fermion densities and allow simulation of real-time dynamics. In recent years there have been successful applications of this framework to 1+1 dimensional lattice gauge theories from a numerical perspective [2], while also leading to a deeper understanding of gauge invariance at the level of the quantum state itself [3]. In the past two years, this initial progress was pushed to some first applications in higher dimensional models. The combination recent advances in both the understanding of symmetries in quantum states and the development of variational tensor-network algorithms in our group could pave the way to more ambitious simulations of lattices gauge theories in higher dimensions. This forms the topic of this master&#39;s thesis.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis project is to gain a deeper understanding of gauge invariance at the level of quantum states, as well as using these insights for simulating lattice gauge theories. This involves several aspects. The first is a theoretical one, and concerns the group's ongoing quest to capture symmetries and their gauging in lattice models by exploring tensor network realizations of higher-form symmetries and dualities. The second is a numerical aspect, in which these insights would be combined with novel variational methods developed in the group to tackle the simulation of higher dimensional lattice gauge theories. Finally, there is an additional technological aspect. Just as insights from the use of quantum simulators have recently been adapted to tensor network studies, the concepts and algorithms developed in this thesis would in turn be investigated in a quantum hardware context. This could potentially lead to advances in the simulation of strongly coupled gauge theories with cold atom quantum simulators, which would be an important application of quantum technologies in the near future.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>In condensed-matter physics, one of the most prominent ways of obtaining accurate numerical data is found in the real of tensor-network algorithms. For 1+1 dimensional quantum systems, these methods have proven to be highly effective, providing a means to study both the ground state, as well as the low-lying excitations. Generalizing to 2+1 dimensional systems, many methods exist and/or are under active development, but the complexity of the algorithms increases drastically. Taking inspiration from the machine learning community, automatic differentiation (AD) can be used to automatically determine derivatives for tensor networks, both simplifying the current state-of-the-art methods, as well as rendering them more efficient.</p>

<p>In this work we will apply these methods to study the Hubbard model, a paradigmatic model for describing strongly-correlated electrons in condensed-matter physics. The Hubbard model essentially describes electrons hopping on a lattice with an energy enalty term when two electrons are on the same site (i.e. an on-site interaction term). We will look at the Hubbard model on the two-dimensional triangular lattice, because this induces non-trivial frustration in the system. For strong interactions between the electrons, the ground state is an insulator where the spins of the electrons are arranged into a magnetically ordered phase. For weak interactions, the system behaves metalic. Inbetween these two phases, a non-magnetic insulating state was recently discovered that breaks time-reversal symmetry and realizes a so-called chiral topological phase. This kind of phase is theoretically well-described by the Laughlin wavefunction that pops up in the description of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and hosts anyonic excitations and gapless chiral edge modes.</p>

<p>This discovery was done using tensor-network methods on a restricted geometry, essentially using one-dimensional methods to study a two-dimensional system. A different study, using variational Monte-Carlo, disputed the existence of this phase, claiming that the chiral state was found due to the restricted geometry.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>In this thesis, we want to settle the debate around the phase diagram of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, using fully two-dimensional tensor networks. To accomplish this, the aforementioned AD methods will first be implemented to optimize the relevant networks, which can then be used to study general two-dimensional systems, including the triangular lattice Hubbard model.</p>


<hr><h2>Haldane conjecture for SU(N) spin chains</h2>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>Promoter(s):</td><td>Laurens Vanderstraeten, Frank Verstraete</td></tr><tr><td>Supervisor(s):</td><td>Lukas Devos</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Forty years ago, Haldane made a prediction on the massive or massless nature of excitations of spin chains depending on which SU(2) representation is realized on each site of the lattice [1]. Additionally, some of these chains were conjectured to give rise to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, as well as to have quasi-particle excitations of fractional charge, so-called spinons. More recently, similar predictions have been made for generic SU(N) chains, driven by both theory and experiment. On the experimental side, cold atomic gasses have been used to create SU(N)-symmetric fermionic systems, realizing exotic states of matter directly in the lab. On the theoretical side, field theory techniques have been used to conjecture a classification of SU(N) chains, with certain cases also belonging to a non-trivial SPT phase.</p>

<p>Numerically, tensor networks have shown to be a state-of-the-art framework to describe spin chains, where matrix product state (MPS) algorithms have provided some of the most accurate results to date. One of the strengths of these methods comes from the feature that global properties are encoded in local tensors. For example, the global SU(N) symmetry can be implemented using local constraints on the tensors, giving rise to improved efficiency, as well as a classification of the different phases of matter. With this in mind, it has now become possible to provide new numerical evidence of the aforementioned conjectures.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>In this thesis, the goal is to understand how to use matrix product states to determine the ground state properties, as well as the low-energy states of a given model. Using the symmetry of the considered models, the student would perform simulations that can verify the Haldane conjectures, even for numerically challenging cases. On top of this, the symmetry uncovers information about the structure of the ground state, which allows to detect non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases, as well as study the elementary spinon excitations on top.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Hawking radiation is a predicted mechanism through which a black hole should thermally radiate particles. While the original derivation was done for free particles near an event horizon, it can equally well be repeated in different settings. For example, hawking radiation was shown to exist in more tangible weakly interacting one dimensional lattice systems.</p>

<p>In this research proposal the student would try to detect and understand hawking radiation in strongly interacting many body systems. These systems typically do not allow for an exact analytical solution and have to be tackled numerically, which can be done using tensor network techniques. It has been shown many times over that the low energy dynamics can typically be described by weakly interacting &quot;quasiparticles&quot; living on a strongly correlated &quot;vacuum&quot;, and these quasiparticles can also be directly targetted in tensor networks.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The student would initially simulate something analogous to an event horizon, and measure the resulting spectrum. In a second stage, we will try to explain/predict this spectrum within the quasiparticle framework, in analogy to the already known weakly interacting case.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Ever since Hawking made his momentous discovery that black holes radiate, the so-called<br />
Hawking radiation, this has been one of the most intriguing and widely studied phenomena<br />
in quantum field theory (QFT) and high energy physics. There remain however some open<br />
questions. One of them is the so-called trans-Planckian problem which arises from the fact<br />
that in the QFT picture the particles at the horizon have wavelengths smaller than the Planck-<br />
scale so that the physical validity of the calculations is uncertain. One way to tackle this<br />
problem is to approach Hawking radiation from lattice theories, which are UV-complete (work<br />
on all scales) and thus do not suffer from this problem.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Recently in our group, we have studied Hawking radiation in the context of quantum many<br />
body physics for free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. We found a new physical picture<br />
in which Hawking radiation arises on the lattice, but some open questions remain. It is the<br />
goal of this thesis to try to answer some of these. This thesis will be a combination of theoretical and numerical work, covering topics such as quantum many body physics, QFT<br />
and relativity. The programming can be done in your favorite language, though preferably in<br />
Python or Julia.</p>

<p>Possible research avenues include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Probing the finite size aspects of our simulations/model towards quantum simulators like&nbsp;optical lattices or BEC&rsquo;s</li>
	<li>Looking at the effects of the discretization of the QFT model on the numerical results</li>
	<li>Studying the effect of adiabatic time evolution in the model</li>
	<li>Doing the simulations at finite, non-zero temperature</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively one could also redo our simulations but now</p>

<ol>
	<li>With bosons instead of fermions</li>
	<li>On a two dimensional lattice instead of one-dimensional</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal of this thesis is intentionally left quite broad so that the student has the possibility<br />
to give his own input and steer the project in a certain direction.</p>


<hr><h2>Increasing the accuracy of quantum-mechanical simulations for strongly correlated functional materials by designing effective Hamiltonians</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>In principle, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation allows us to fully predict a system&rsquo;s multidimensional wavefunction and behavior. However, solving this equation exactly is not trivial and even impossible for realistic materials containing more than a handful degrees of freedom. Density functional theory (DFT), in which the 3D electron density is the central quantity instead of the multidimensional wavefunction, is therefore the most popular quantum mechanical approach in solid state science nowadays. However, the accuracy of a DFT calculation strongly depends on which of the many available exchange-correlation functionals is chosen.1 Furthermore, the currently available functionals all fail in the case of systems exhibiting strong electron correlation. This typically occurs when electrons become localized, density fluctuations vary widely over the system, and bands crossing the Fermi energy have a narrow bandwidth. This is the case, for instance, in transition metal-compounds, rare-earth compounds, and organic conductors. Strong electron correlation should therefore be taken into account by using higher-level simulation techniques, such as the random phase approximation (RPA) or wavefunction based tensor networks. The latter method however come at a higher computational cost, therefore a viable strategy consists in constructing effective Hamiltonians, where higher accuracy calculations are conducted in a lower dimensional space &nbsp;made of the specific electronic bands that are responsible for the strong electron correlations.&nbsp; &nbsp;This hybrid approach relies on the computational efficiency of DFT and combines it with more accurate methods for those states that are responsible for strong electron correlations.&nbsp; A key question is the construction of the effective Hamiltonians for the problematic electron bands.2 The strategy that will be adopted here is to start from the DFT calculations, isolate the bands that are close to the Fermi level and construct maximally localized Wannier functions, which are a set of real-space localized orbitals forming the real-space counterpart of Block orbitals.2,3 They have the advantage that they span precisely the required energy range and that they naturally incorporate hybridization and bonding appropriate to their local environment. Using Wannier functions, the effective systems, with substantially fewer degrees of freedom, can be simulated at a higher level of theory, whereas the other bands are still treated with DFT.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>In this thesis, it our aim to develop a methodology to construct the effective Hamiltonians that are able to treat the electron correlations with higher accuracy.&nbsp; To this end we will design a hybrid RPA/DFT or tensor/DFT scheme to increase the accuracy of quantum-mechanical simulations for technologically important materials which are prone to strong electron correlation. To this end, first the electron bands of the systems will be calculated via DFT and the relevant bands around the Fermi level that need to be considered in the effective Hamiltonian will be selected. These bands should be isolated and should be transformed to maximally localized Wannier functions. These Wannier orbitals then define the low-energy subspace of interest from which in the second stage of this thesis the hopping amplitudes and interaction terms will be computed at the RPA level of theory. Alternatively the effective Hamiltonian in the reduced subspace may be treated using other tensor networks methods, that are being developed within the Quantum Group of Prof. Verstraete.&nbsp; Such hybrid DFT/RPA or DFT/tensor based models show a lot of potential to reach unprecedented accuracy for systems showing strong electron correlations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Figure 1: Atomic structure of MIL-53(Fe) and CsPbI3, the two materials showing strong electron correlation investigated in this thesis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two specific systems featuring strong electron correlation will be investigated in this thesis, both shown in the figure. At first instance, you will use the hybrid RPA/DFT scheme to determine accurate ground state energies of the metastable phases of the flexible metal-organic framework MIL-53(Fe).4 This material can undergo a phase transition between a closed and an open pore phase. Therefore, it can potentially be used in sensing, gas storage, and separation applications. To correctly predict under which conditions it is able to breath, the energies of the different phases should be determined with an error that is as low as possible. DFT fails in this regard, because the presence of various possible spin configurations has a large impact on the electron properties.</p>

<p>A second system of interest in this thesis proposal is the metal halide perovskite CsPbI3.5 This material shows strong light absorption, long charge carrier lifetimes, and high carrier mobility, which makes it very interesting for various optical applications such as solar panels and medical scanners. DFT typically fails to determine accurate band gaps of perovskites. As a result, most simulations on this system have been performed at a very high level of theory with high computational cost. By using the hybrid RPA/DFT scheme, the computational load to determine accurate electron band schemes could be severely reduced, allowing us to consider larger perovskite systems and account for the experimental doping of this system.</p>

<p>This thesis relies on a collaboration between the Center for Molecular Modeling (Van Speybroeck) having ample expertise in the properties of technologically important materials and their simulation with Density Functional Theory Methods and the Quantum Group (Verstraete) having ample expertise in tensor networks and the theory of quantum entanglement and it application to condensed matter systems.&nbsp; The potential student for this topic should have interest in fundamental aspects of quantum simulations and their application to important materials for engineering applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hartree-Fock (HF) procedure is a fully quantum mechanical method that finds the wavefunction of a system by solving the Schr&ouml;dinger equation in a self-consistent manner. However, while HF exactly accounts for electron exchange, it completely neglects electron correlation. Density functional theory (DFT) can mitigate this challenge, as it solves for the ground state electron density instead of the multidimensional wavefunction in HF, and as it can approximately account for electron correlation via an appropriate choice of the so-called exchange-correlation functional. DFT is therefore the method of choice in many solid-state investigations. However, while some DFT functionals achieve chemical accuracy for certain properties in simple systems such as closed-shell organic molecules [1], it fails for systems that exhibit strong electron correlation, such as metal halide perovskites (MHPs).</p>

<p>MHPs exhibit extraordinary properties for photovoltaic applications, such as high absorptivity, long electron-hole diffusion lengths, and high charge mobility [2]. Recently, the maximum obtained solar cell efficiency of perovskite absorbers has risen substantially, up to 25.7%. MHPs adopt the perovskite crystal structure, with an ABX<sub>3</sub> chemical formula containing B metal cations and X halide anions. Since strongly correlated electron fluctuations (dispersive interactions) can occur between the A cations and the metal halide network, DFT typically fails to describe these materials. Moreover, MHPs doped with rare-earth compounds show improved photovoltaic properties. However, these (post-)transition metals occupying the B sites exhibit open d-and f-electron shells for which static electron correlation is important in addition to the aforementioned dynamic electron correlation, further limiting the usage of DFT.</p>

<p>Figure 1: (a) The reduced Hedin equations after the GW approximation, (b) these equations are coupled as shown by the diagram. (c) Within the GW approximation different approaches are possible to determine the self-energy, such as the scGW and G0W0 methods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To accurately describe these technologically relevant yet complex MHP materials, fundamental many-body methods such as the Green&rsquo;s function many-body perturbation approach (GW) are necessary. From many-body perturbation theory, the coupled Hedin&rsquo;s equations can be derived [3]. The GW approximation simplifies these coupled equations to those shown in Figure 2. The GW method is used to derive the self-energy (&Sigma;), which incorporates the interaction of a quasi-particle and the interacting system by taking into account screened Coulomb interactions (W). The electron quasiparticle combines the electron itself as well as its effect on the system with which it interacts, which is necessary since adding or removing electrons to the system also alters the positions of the other electrons in the systems. As shown in Figure 1, different approaches are possible to derive the self-energy. For instance, it can be derived self-consistently (the scGW method) or with only one iteration such that the self-energy is determined by the initial Green&rsquo;s function G0 (the G0W0 method). With the self-energy obtained in the GW method, an effective potential can be constructed to find quasi-particle energies even for strongly correlated systems such as MHPs.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>During the thesis, you will dive into many-body theory to familiarize yourself with the complex concepts underlying the GW method and afterwards apply both the GW method and DFT to determine the ground state energies and band structure of different perovskite systems. The aim of this thesis is twofold. First, we want to investigate to which extent DFT and GW, with their different approximations, can account for dynamic and static electron correlation. Second, we want to gain insight for which materials and dopants electron correlation becomes important and, given a certain degree of electron correlation, which method suffices to capture it.</p>

<p>Figure 2: Depiction of two perovskite materials: (a) SrVO<sub>3</sub> and (b) Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first material we will investigate in this thesis is the cubic perovskite oxide SrVO<sub>3</sub> (see Figure 2a). It is a typical example of a strongly correlated material and a lot of benchmark literature data is available on the accuracy of various many body techniques. Therefore, it will be possible to benchmark different theoretical many-body approaches and compare the obtained results with published theoretical methods and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments [4]. Within this thesis topic a collaboration is foreseen with the Quantum Group (Verstraete) who has ample expertise on quantum many-body techniques based on tensor networks. For relatively small systems like SrVO<sub>3</sub>, very advanced methods such as periodic coupled-cluster calculations or tensor based methods could be benchmarked too to reach quantum accuracy. Following this benchmark study, we will investigate more technologically relevant MHPs, starting with CsSnBr<sub>3</sub> and systematically increasing the complexity. First, we will exchange Sn for Pb, for which relativistic effects have to be taken into account due to its higher mass. Afterwards, we will exchange Cs<sup>+</sup> for the larger and more dynamic methylammonium ion. Finally, we will investigate double perovskites, for which the B cations (Sn<sup>2+</sup> or Pb<sup>2+</sup>) are replaced with two different metals, such as Ag<sup>+</sup> and Bi<sup>3+</sup>, yielding Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub> (see Figure 2b). These double perovskites are of particular interest because they show great potential for photovoltaic applications [5]. Moreover, doping these structures with a rare-earth element such as Eu en Er leads to increased charge carrier mobilities. Therefore, our final goal will be to investigate the effect of doping on the electronic properties of Cs<sub>2</sub>AgBiBr<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>In spring 2022 we are launching the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent. Worldwide such cold atom experiments are currently leading the way in our explorations of the quantum realm. In summary, a BEC consists of &gt;10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case), that are cooled to temperatures T&lt;1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one coherent quantum state. The spectacular advances in controlling and manipulating the cold BEC atoms allow the experimental realization of many different exotic quantum phenomena like quantum tunneling, superfluidity and quantum non-equilibrium physics.</p>

<p>BECs are a perfect playing field to study phenomena like relaxation, (pre-)thermalization and turbulence in the quantum regime.<br />
Much progress has been made to the precise control over the trapping environment the BEC is in and their dynamical evolution can be followed over relatively long time scales.<br />
Much of the dynamics can be captured by the (non-linear) mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE). However, these do not include the quantum fluctuations on the coherent mean-field state. The exact limits of the GPE is still an important open question.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis is to set up and study BECs out of equilibrium, studying the excitations and the interactions to understand their role in the dynamical evolution of BECs.</p>

<p>By designing specific quenches or driving sequences, it will be possible to produce specific excitations on top of the BEC groundstate and analyse the ensuing dynamical evolution. A step further is to target multiple excitations at once and study the interactions between these (quasi-)particles.</p>

<p>This thesis touches upon aspects of quantum optics, numerical simulations and cold atom physics. Depending on their interests, the student can focus more on the theoretical, numerical or experimental part.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Transport measurement is one of the most basic experimental tools to study materials, which, on the other hand, is often able to detect the most fundamental physics in materials. Two prominent examples are the superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect, which are both first discovered in transport experiments, and they have exhibited extremely rich and profound physics properties of the system. Besides the electronic current measurements, the spin transport is also utilized as effective experimental probes of quantum materials. The spin current has been utilized to detect different excitations which carry nonzero spin, including superconducting quasiparticles, magnons and spinons.</p>

<p>Given the importance of transport measurements, it would be desirable to develop a reliable theoretical approach to calculate these transport properties. For low-dimensional interacting systems, one choice is to compute the transport properties from real time simulations of the matrix product state (MPS). However, the entanglement entropy of the system typically grows linearly with the time, which leads to a exponential growth of the required bond dimension of the matrix product state. This expoential growth of the bond dimension typically limits the MPS real-time simulations to short time scales and small system sizes, and makes it very difficult to do quantum transport calculations based on MPS.</p>

<p>Recently, it is proposed that [1, 2], for the calculation of quantum transport problems, if one respects the scattering structure of the reservior modes when constructing the MPS, it is possible to reduce the originally linear growth of the entanglement entropy to a logarithmic one. This gives rise to a linear growth of the bond dimension with respect to time, and makes the steady state regime accessable to the MPS simulations.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of the thesis is to understand and employ the method proposed by Refs. [1, 2] and investigate how to extend it to spin transport in low-dimensional qauntum spin systems. One possible physical application of the approach is to study the spin transport property of the spin-1/ 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain at finite temperatures, and investigate its relation to the spinon excitations of the system.</p>

<p>In spring 2022 we are launching the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent. Worldwide such cold atom experiments are currently leading the way in our explorations of the quantum realm. In summary, a BEC consists of &gt;10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case), that are cooled to temperatures T&lt;1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one coherent quantum state. The spectacular advances in controlling and manipulating the cold BEC atoms allow the experimental realization of many different exotic quantum phenomena like quantum tunneling, superfluidity and quantum non-equilibrium physics.</p>

<p>The generation, manipulation and imaging of a BEC requires many components -coils, drivers, lasers, shutters, cameras&ndash; that each need to perform specific actions at specific times. As such one can compare a BEC system to an orchestra where, to produce a symphony, every instrument has to play the right tune at the right instance.&nbsp; While our instrumental control system can perform the required timed actions, the challenge is to find optimal &lsquo;scores&rsquo;, or in this case &lsquo;recipes&rsquo;, leading to robust BECs.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Manually adapting individual component values to find optima for BEC is time-consuming and interplay between multiple parameters could be missed. The goal of this thesis is to develop and study numerical optimization sequences that will lead to ideal BECs.</p>

<p>The instrument control system can be commanded via a python script that runs optimization code. There is a lot of flexibility to encode protocols driven by self-defined cost-functions. Different experimental scenarios will call for different BEC-benchmarks. An objective is to find which cost function and/or machine learning protocol is best suited for which scenario, while looking at the dependencies on key components in the set-up.</p>

<p>This thesis will give the student the opportunity to apply and develop machine learning techniques on a state-of-the-art ultra-cold atom experiment.</p>

<p>Since early 2022 we are launching&nbsp;the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent (within the quantum group, in collaboration with the photonics department). Worldwide such cold atom experiments are currently leading the way in our explorations of the quantum realm. In summary, a BEC consists of &gt;10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case), that are cooled to temperatures T&lt;1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one coherent quantum state. As such, BECs allow the experimental realization of many different exotic quantum phenomena like quantum tunneling, superfluidity, or even the quantum simulation of black holes.</p>

<p>The cooling, trapping, and manipulation of the atoms relies on both magnets (through the Zeeman effect) and lasers (through the dipole-interaction). In particular our BEC set-up uses a state-of-the-art combination of magnetic fields generated by an atom chip and a laser projection system that operates with an Accousto Optical Deflector (AOD). With the latter system we will be able to &#39;paint&#39; flexible (both in space and time) potentials on the atom cloud, allowing for new original BEC experiments. It is also this latter system that is the subject of this thesis.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis is to study and develop optimal protocols for driving the AOD, in function of the specific potentials in the atom cloud that we want to realize with our set-up.</p>

<p>In short, an AOD relies on the accousto optical effect, which amounts to an effective interaction between sound waves and light within certain crystals. By driving the AOD with ultra-sonic sound waves, the laserbeam is deflected in a direction that depends on the sound frequency. Upon projection through two microscopes, this beam direction in the end translates to a position of a laser spot on the atom cloud.</p>

<p>For finding the optimal driving protocols there are two different, yet very much connected aspects that will have to be studied. First there is the issue of the driving itself, where one has the option to drive the AOD with a single frequency, resulting in one spot at at time, or with a superposition of multiple frequencies resulting in multiple spots at the same time. The second issue is the effect on the atom cloud, where the idea is to generate effective time-averaged potentials by scanning one or multiple spots very fast through the cloud.</p>

<p>The work on this thesis will require a combination of photonic physics, numerical simulation, quantum theory, and experimental cold atom physics. Depending on their&nbsp;interests, the student will have the freedom to focus more on particular aspects of the problem.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Central to the realization of a large scale quantum computer is the ability to store and manipulate quantum states in a way that tolerates errors arising from environmental noise. By storing information in degrees of freedom that cannot be locally accessed, topological codes provide some protection.</p>

<p>The simplest topological codes are toric/surface codes. Although incredibly technically challenging, there has been experimental progress towards implementation of surface code[1]. Unfortunately, the logical gates that can be implemented in a fault-tolerant way is severely limited in this class of codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One way to improve the computational power of a topological code is to introduce defects, such as boundaries or interfaces[2]. Ideally, with the inclusion of the right defects, a universal set of gates can be implemented. This forms the topic of this master&#39;s thesis.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis is to investigate how the inclusion of defects influences the computational power of the code. In particular, the student will start by understanding how universal quantum computation is achieved in the surface code via inclusion of `non-Abelian islands&#39; in [3]. Following this, we will apply the analysis to other kinds of islands, more realistic from an experimental point of view, and see if universality can be retained. If not, we will examine what conditions are needed for it to be recovered.</p>

<p>Since early 2022 we are launching the first Belgian Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) experiment at UGent. Worldwide such cold atom experiments are currently leading the way in our explorations of the quantum realm. In summary, a BEC consists of &gt;10.000 bosonic atoms (Rb87 in our case), that are cooled to temperatures T&lt;1 microKelvin. At these temperatures a new phase of matter emerges, the so called Bose-Einstein condensate, with all the atoms condensed into one coherent quantum state, that can be controlled and manipulated through the application of magnetic and optical fields.</p>

<p>In this thesis we want to approach BEC physics from the quantum information standpoint. The underlying principle of quantum information is that quantum mechanics allows us to carry certain tasks that would be impossible in a classical world. This becomes especially apparent when natural limitations apply to the allowed operations. Typically this limitation comes from a notion of locality, where two parties (the infamous Alice and Bob) can only perform local quantum operations on their respective subsystems, possibly supplemented with a classical communication channel. This is the standard framework of the so called&nbsp; LOCC protocols, that for instance allow for quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution.</p>

<p>However, in [1] it was realized that additional limitations on the allowed operations can lead to new interesting possibilities. In particular, in many systems of interest we have so called superselection rules. Specifically, in the context of BEC experiments, the superselection rule is that coherent superpositions of states with a different atom number are forbidden. Or equivalently, that all (local or non-local) measurements have to commute with the total atom number. As shown in [1], such an additional constraint allows for perfect data hiding, where some information can be distributed between Alice and Bob, in such a way that they can only read it if they are provided with the means to perform joint measurements.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this thesis is to explore the possibility of experimentally realizing a protocol for perfect data hiding on our BEC set-up. For the experiment that we have in mind, Alice and Bob would correspond to two spatially separated BEC clouds that are still coherent. The hidden data can be encoded in the relative phase between the two clouds. While the joined measurement for reading out this data, can be performed by interfering these clouds with a third &#39;reference cloud&#39;. A main challenge for this experiment will be the control on the trapping potential that in our case is provided by magnetic fields from an atom chip in combination with a highly flexible optical field from a laser projection system.</p>

<p>The student working on this project will the have the opportunity to perform original experiments on a state-of-the-art installation, while at the same time learning about quantum information, optics and cold atom physics.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The promise of near-term applications of quantum technologies for information processing has been the driving force behind the development of quantum computation and information, propelling it as one of the most active research fields of the past decades. Because of significant efforts from both the theoretical and experimental side, quantum technologies will soon reach a point where noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices can challenge the limits of what classical architectures are capable of. Despite these encouraging prospects, the realization of a large-scale universal fault-tolerant quantum computer remains a principal challenge to be tackled in the decades to come. Protecting quantum information from errors due to interactions with the environment is the central challenge that must be overcome in order to achieve scalable quantum computation. The discovery of quantum error correcting codes in the 1990s already proved that quantum information could indeed be effectively protected from decoherence. This protection from noise relies on an encoding of quantum information into a physical system in a non-local way, such that the information cannot be destroyed by any local error. The search for such an encoding that is suitable for experimental implementation forms a highly relevant research topic.</p>

<p>Many of the current leading proposals for fault-tolerant architectures rely on the concept of topological order. This is an exotic type of long-range quantum order that cannot be described in terms of any local order parameter. Topological quantum error correction exploits this phenomenon by encoding quantum information in the global topological properties of a system, which is then inherently protected from local errors. Although these current proposals provide a robust way of storing quantum information, they require an enormous overhead in order to actually process the stored information [1]. A way around this problem is to use codes that possess a more intricate non-Abelian topological order, which allow for universal computation without the need for any additional machinery. However, the study of non-Abelian topological codes has been restricted to mostly theoretical considerations. A significant effort is still required to bring these codes into the realm of practical implementations.</p>

<p>Topological order can be captured in an elegant way using the framework of tensor networks, which has been explored by our group in recent years. Building on these concepts, we have recently proposed a framework for error correction using non-Abelian topological order, and have provided a numerical demonstration that successful error correction is indeed possible in this setting [2]. However, some important steps must still be taken in order to transform this first proof of concept into a concrete and competitive proposal for an experimental realization of a quantum architecture. This forms the topic of this master&#39;s thesis.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>This thesis project aims to explore the paradigm of non-Abelian topological codes as a viable road to scalable quantum computation that circumvents a substantial overhead which plagues more conventional architectures. Concretely, the goal of this project is to analyze what resources would be required for a minimal working realization of a non-Abelian code, and to investigate its performance. Such a comprehensive resource assessment necessarily precedes any possible practical implementations, and is currently still lacking for non-Abelian codes. This general goal can be broken down into several parts. The first is a more theoretical one, in which the student will expand on the framework established by the group in order to construct a non-Abelian code that is specifically tailored toward experimental realization using the minimal amount of resources possible. This will involve exploring different code interactions, experimenting with adaptive lattices, and investigating different encodings that allow for a practical geometry. A second aspect will be the numerical simulation of error correction in this adapted code, in order to demonstrate the possibility of successful error correction and to compare the performance of different proposals. Finally, a crucial step will be the translation of a proposed code into a complete framework for an error correction architecture that may be realized in the lab. This will consist of identifying a suitable experimental paradigm currently used for the construction of quantum hardware and compiling and optimizing concrete quantum circuits for all logical and error correction operations required, tailored to the specific hardware technology. At that point, the actual performance of this complete framework could be analyzed using currently available quantum simulators (by IBM, Google, Xanadu and the likes). Depending on the result, a minimal working example of obtained code that is suitable for near-term experimental realization could be designed which could eventually be realized in a collaboration with an experimental group in the future.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The theoretical understanding and numerical simulation of strongly-correlated quantum materials has been one of the long-standing challenges in physics: Whereas the microscopic quantum-mechanical equations for describing e.g. electrons in a material have been known for over a century, solving these equations for a large number of them is prohibitively expensive. As a result, the use of approximate methods such as mean-field theory, Hartree-Fock theory, perturbation theory, etc have flourished and can actually yield very accurate descriptions of the relevant physics of many materials. For example, band theory often describes the electronic structure of many metallic or insulating systems, and Fermi-liquid theory describes the occurrence of quasiparticles in these systems.</p>

<p>One prominent example of such an approximate method is density functional theory (DFT), which describes the correlated nature of many-electron systems by designing an independent-particle model with effective exchange-correlation functionals. Of course, finding the exact functional is equally difficult as solving the quantum many-electron problem, but over the course of the last fifty years many proposals have been made for approximate functionals that allow to simulate electronic materials and large molecules with high precision.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the search for numerical methods that capture correlated quantum many-body behavior continues, and recently the advent of tensor-network methods has made it possible to capture quantum correlations or entanglement in a new original way. These methods are a lot more expensive than an independent particle model such as Hartree-Fock theory or DFT, but they have the promise of truly describing the physics of strong quantum materials.</p>

<p>In the light of the emerging field of quantum science and technology, where strong quantum correlations are used as an essential resource for generating new exotic physical phenomena, the need for accurate and scalable numerical methods for simulating strong quantum correlations is more pressing than ever. Therefore, a fruitful combination of the the efficiency of DFT and the quantumness of tensor networks is highly needed.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>In this master thesis proposal, we aim to realize this combination of DFT and tensor networks for simulating metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are materials that are built from inorganic building blocks (metal centers) that are connected by organic linkers, and have become extremely attractive in applications such as gas storage, separation, catalysis, drug delivery, etc. It appears that the quantum correlations between the electrons and spin configurations are very strong in these materials, and the accurate description or simulation goes beyond a simple DFT calculation.</p>

<p>We want to combine DFT and tensor networks in a specific way, where we start from the assumption that most of the electrons in these systems are weakly correlated, and that only a limited number of electron bands require a full quantum-mechanical treatment. We use the scalability of DFT to treat this first group of weakly-correlated electrons and design an effective model for the correlated bands, which we then tackle using tensor networks.</p>

<p>We will look at the class of MIL-53 type materials, where the metal atoms are aligned along one-dimensional metal-oxide chains. For these materials, the effective model will be a one-dimensional (1-D) electron system with hopping amplitudes and interaction terms. For 1-D models, we can use very powerful tensor network algorithms for obtaining the ground-state properties and compute the low-lying excitations that appear in spectroscopic measurements.</p>

<p>The main focus in this proposal is in the low-lying dynamics of the effective 1-D model, which can be studied using the time-dependent variational principle. Here we would like to investigate in how entanglement builds up through time after we suddenly quench the system, and whether we can understand this entanglement growth in terms of effective quasiparticles that propagate through the system. It would be very interesting to investigate the emergent scaling behaviour of the entanglement properties if we quench across a quantum phase transition.</p>

<p>In this proposal, the student has the opportunity to collaborate with the Center for Molecular Modeling, which has a great expertise in simulating MOF-type materials and DFT simulations, and the Quantum Group, which has a long-standing track record in developing tensor-network techniques.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>One of the central research topics in the field of quantum many-body physics is the search for and characterization of so-called symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. The idea behind SPT phases is that the space of states that belong to the same phase in the absence of symmetries, falls apart in different disconnected components due to topological obstructions when symmetries are imposed. This picture can be made explicit in the language of tensor networks, which provide a way to represent many-body wave functions in terms of local tensors that lay bare the entanglement routing. In the celebrated work by Chen et al. [1] it was shown that such topological obstructions in 1+1D arise because symmetries can act projectively ie. up to a phase on the entanglement degrees of freedom of the tensor network under study. In their work, they considered on-site symmetries (such as spin rotations), parity and time-reversal. The relevant tensor networks in this case are the so-called matrix product states (MPS).</p>

<p>Recently, we showed in [2] using similar tensor network techniques that also spatial symmetries (such as glide reflections possibly combined with a rotation), classified by the 7 so-called frieze symmetry groups [3], can protect SPT phases. We identified the topological obstructions and found representative tensor network states for every of the found phases. An interesting and very relevant question is the generalization of these ideas to 2+1D. In this case the relevant tensor networks are the projected entangled pair states (PEPS).</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation of spatial symmetries in tensor networks.&nbsp;<br />
In a first stage the student should familiarize her/himself with tensor network methods and the relevant concepts of SPT phases. Next, a few different goals can be pursued, both theoretical and computational in nature. One possibility is to extend the work in [2] to also incorporate on-site symmetries that can interact non-trivially with the spatial symmetries. With the found MPS ans&auml;tze, one could carry out some interesting numerical simulations using the extensive numerical toolbox developed in our group [4]. Another ambitious goal is to consider the 17 wallpaper groups [5] and the SPT classification they give rise to. This SPT classification was recently obtained using field theory methods [6], but we wish to invoke these symmetries directly on the PEPS tensors. The student could also try to understand how spatial symmetries can be exploited in PEPS simulations in which spatial symmetries, possibly combined with global on-site symmetries, are very relevant for the simulation of materials. A model that could be investigated is for example the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice, which is believed to be a good description of Herbertsmithite.</p>

<p>The theoretical understanding and numerical simulation of strongly-correlated quantum materials has been one of the long-standing challenges in physics: Whereas the microscopic quantum-mechanical equations for describing e.g. electrons in a material have been known for over a century, solving these equations for a large number of them is prohibitively expensive. As a result, the use of approximate methods such as mean-field theory, Hartree-Fock theory, perturbation theory, etc have flourished and can actually yield very accurate descriptions of the relevant physics of many materials. For example, band theory often describes the electronic structure of many metallic or insulating systems, and Fermi-liquid theory describes the occurrence of quasiparticles in these systems. Another example is density functional theory (DFT), which is an independent particle model for many-electron systems that revolves around the use of exchange-correlation functionals for capturing the electron correlations; in the last fifty years, DFT has worked itself up to the default method for simulating large many-electron systems.</p>

<p>There are, however, still a number of materials that resist such approximate descriptions, and for which still no satisfactory understanding has been acquired. The most outstanding example in the field of condensed-matter physics is the mystery of high-Tc superconductivity: layered materials for which superconductivity persists up to temperatures at which any conventional description of superconductivity (i.e., BCS theory) would predict that a normal conductor has formed. It appears that strong quantum correlations in these systems are responsible for the superconducting properties, which falls outside the scope of traditional approximate methods such as mean field of perturbation theory. The most famous class of high-Tc superconductors are cuprates.</p>

<p>In the last years, a new theoretical and numerical framework has been developed that can account for strong quantum correlations or entanglement in quantum many-body systems: tensor networks. Because of their direct modeling of the quantum entanglement in many-body systems, they are typically applied to microscopic Hamiltonians for simplified toy models, which somehow capture the essential physics of a given materials. In the case of the cuprate superconductors, an effective model is the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian, for which, indeed, tensor networks can predict the phase diagram with unprecedented precision.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>In order to make progress in understanding real-life high-Tc materials such as the cuprates &ndash; and for designing other materials with superconducting properties, with an eye on technological applications &ndash; we need to go beyond toy models and come up with ab-initio calculations of these materials. In this thesis proposal, we will make use of a hybrid DFT/tensor-network method for simulating a specific cuprate material La2-xSrxCuO4, which has been verified experimentally and that probably goes beyond the simple Hubbard model.</p>

<p>The crucial idea in this proposal is to use DFT for obtaining an effective band model for this material, such that we can isolate the electronic degrees of freedom that exhibit strong correlations. Indeed, it is expected that most electron bands are, in fact, only weakly-correlated, and that only a few bands contribute to the phenomenon of superconductivity. The DFT solution allows to project out all these weakly-correlated bands, after which we can find real-space localized Wannier orbitals that describe the relevant electrons. We can compute hopping amplitudes between the orbitals and interaction terms. In the next stage, we use tensor networks to treat this effective strongly-correlated model head-on, using tensor networks. We will not only study the ground-state properties of this materials, but also the dynamics of the charge carriers (which are supposed to determine the mysterious Cooper pairs and the superconductivity), which can be readily measured in angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.</p>

<p>We expect the student to collaborate with researchers of the Center for Molecular Modeling and the Quantum Group; the former group has a large expertise in DFT calculations and Wannier-localization, whereas the latter has developed the main tensor-network algorithms that will be used in this work.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>For a statistical mechanics system on a lattice, computing the partition function leads to the knowledge of all physical properties (magnetisation, pressure, specific heat, ...) and for a local Hamiltonian this is done by summing over all possible configurations of the system, where each configuration is weighted with the product of the local Boltzmann weights. Conveniently, this can be translated to the language of tensor networks by assigning a tensor to each vertex and contracting the resulting diagram.</p>

<p>Once in the language of tensor networks, there exists a plethora of tools and algorithms, readily implemented on a computer, for the exact and/or approximate contraction of the resulting network. Nevertheless, in the zero temperature limit, dealing with exponentially large or small numbers on computers with finite precision numerics leads to issues. This problem can be resolved by working with the exponents directly and going to the zero-temperature limit, such that new addition and multiplication laws naturally appear, by replacing addition with a max operation, and replacing multiplication with regular addition.</p>

<p>These are the defining relations of the tropical semiring [1], or the max-plus algebra. Working with tensors over this semiring instead of over the usual complex numbers circumvents the aforementioned problems, while still retaining the commutative, associative an distributive properties, but at the cost of losing the possibility to define an additive inverse.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The student would commence by gaining an understanding of tropical numbers and their implementation, using the results of [2] as a starting point. Combining this with existing state-of-the-art tensor network methods of our group, the goal is to explore what stands and what breaks down by making the switch to tropical numbers. Ultimately, the goal is to simulate classical systems in their low temperature regime, comparing the accuracy and performance of these new methods with analytic results, as well as with standard tensor network methods.</p>

<p>Finally, the tropical numbers lend themselves not only to the simulation of classical systems at low temperatures, but are also important in the context of combinatorical problems such as frustrated spin glass systems [2], in system- and control theory [3], or for deep neural networks [4].</p>
